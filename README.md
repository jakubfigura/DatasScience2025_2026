# 🔋 🌊 Machine learning models for energy generation preditions ⚡ 🌀

### Authors: Jakub Figura, Paweł Nykiel. 

This repository contains the preparation of machine learning models for data set, which consists of positions and absorbed power outputs of wave energy converters (WECs) in four real wave scenarios from the souther coast of Australia. 
The dat set is publicliy available here:
